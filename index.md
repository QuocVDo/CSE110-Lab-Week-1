 ## Introduction
 
 **Major:** Computer Engineering

 **Years of Programming Experience:** 3
 
 Hi! I'm Quoc! As a programmer I think I can claim that I am fairly inexperienced with only about ~~2~~ 3 years of programming behind my belt. Currently I have the most experience in *C, C++, and Java* but I'm  also learning *Python* for that sweet, sweet, ML content that i'm hoping to dive into soon. Oh and I also know *MatLab* if you count that as a language. Outside of the programming life, I also have a variety of hobbies including: Longboarding around campus, cooking, playing video games, watching anime, and reading manga! 

 ## Favorite Quote
 My favorite programming related quote is by Chris Helmann who says:
 > Java is to JavaScript what car is to Carpet.

 ## Quoting Code
 ```
